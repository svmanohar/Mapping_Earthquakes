# Mapping Earthquakes

## Technologies used

* Javascript
* HTML5
* CSS
* Leaflet
* GeoJSON

## Overview

This project pulls GeoJSON data and applies them to a Leaflet map, allowing a user to visualize earthquake data (location, magnitude) from the past 7 days. As this pulls from a live source (United States Geographical Survey), we can consdier this to be a dynamic map. 

Using Leaflet layer controls, the user is able to toggle the type of earthquakes they want to view (low, high magnitude), as well as the map style they want to visualize the data in. The map also contains historic tectonic plate boundary data from 2002, which helps provide meaning to why certain patterns of earthquakes occur in specific clusters.
